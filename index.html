        <p>
          You fill me up 'til you're empty
          I took too much and you let me
          We've been down all these roads before
          And what we found don't live there anymore
          It's dark
          It's cold
          If my hand is not the one you're meant to hold
          Maybe you'd be happier with someone else
          Maybe loving me's the reason you can't love yourself
          Before I turn your heart into a ghost town
          Show me everything we built so I can tear it all down
          Down
          Down, down, down
          You know I'll stay don't you tempt me
          But all this weight is getting heavy
          Been holding up what wasn't meant to stand
          I turned this love into a wasteland
